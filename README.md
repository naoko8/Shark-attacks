# Shart-attacks
This is my own project for fun! The project is not finished yet. 

It appears that quantity of women whos swimming event ended fatally is higher then mens. 
I checked specially in USA and globally. In both of them, quantity of women were higher. Isnt it strange? 
I was thinking men would be in higher range, because I thought men swim far away from the shore(its funny that I thought that way).
I guess now I have to find out why. 

I will also try to find out probability of dying from shark attack...
